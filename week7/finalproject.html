					<h1>WHO AM I TODAY?</h1>
					<h2>This pattern was inspired by my identity as an immigrant. This is a topic that I have been exploring consistently recently, and thus believed it would make an appropriate addition to this collection of sketches. Thus the sketch itself consists of the colours of the Indian and Singaporean flags dripping down the screen unpredictably, reflecting the often volatile sense of identity that I feel.</h2>

					<h1>HEARTBEAT</h1>
					<h2>This pattern allows the user to interact with it and control the “heartbeat” of the pattern, i.e. the speed at the concentric circles expand and contract. It is not only representative of the constant highs and lows that I have felt in my own personal life recently, but also allows the viewer to see themselves and their personal mindset reflected in a highly visual form.</h2>

					<h1>WHERE DO THE MEMORIES GO?</h1>
					<h2>This pattern is inspired by the fading of memories as time passes. It prompts the viewer for their age and then displays a vibrant collection of orbs flashing the same number of times. Then, in an almost foreboding manner, at 1 fps, each of the orbs begins to turn black as the viewer can do nothing but sit back and watch as the symbolic representations of their memories are wiped away into nothingness.</h2>
