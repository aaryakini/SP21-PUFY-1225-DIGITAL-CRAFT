			<p>Aarya Kini is a South-Indian artist, who has spent the majority of her life growing up in the vibrant island-nation of Singapore. Often inspired by literature as well as personal and collective experiences, themes that she has been exploring in her practice lately include culture, identity, space, and memory. Aarya also loves experimenting with everything from painting to performance, but tends to gravitate most towards mixed-media and digital works. Currently she is a freshman at Parsons School of Design, majoring in Communication Design.</p>

				<h2 class="heading2">Object / Place</h2>

				<h3 class="heading3">Project Instructions</h3>

				<p>Pick an object or a place that interests you to share with your homework partner. Write a brief paragraph about what about the object/place interests you, include any feedback your partner gave you.</p>

				<h3 class="heading3">Submission</h3>

				<p>The object that I have chosen to work on is earrings. I chose earrings as they are a piece of jewellery that always remind me of my mother and thus hold a special place in my heart. My mother has always loved wearing earrings and has a large collection that includes pairs from when she was my age and going to university. She has handed down a number of these earrings to me and I love wearing them not only for their special sentimental value but also their irreplaceable vintage beauty. Moreover, she is also quite the artist herself and one of her passions is making handmade jewellery. When I was a toddler, she would let me make beads out of clay, and then she would paint them and turn them into earrings and necklaces for me to wear. And so, a lot of my pictures from when I was around 5 - 12 years old include earrings that my mother made just for me.<br>Apart from this, my partner June's feedback was quite helpful in picking an object. Initially I was going to work on a place - more specifically, the shophouses of Singapore - but June helped me realise that this might be too complex of an endeavour given that there are not too many reference images of the patterns that decorate the houses making it harder to replicate them in detail. Apart from this there also a number of non-geometric forms that might be difficult to recreate. Consequently, I chose to work on earrings as working with shapes on a smaller scale will allow me to become more proficient at using Javascript while also focusing on creating cohesive compositions.</p>
