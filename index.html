			<h2>Aarya Kini</h2>
			<p>Aarya Kini is a South-Indian artist, who has spent the majority of her life growing up in the vibrant island-nation of Singapore. Often inspired by literature as well as personal and collective experiences, themes that she has been exploring in her practice lately include the human condition, (cultural) identity, and dream imagery. Aarya also loves experimenting with everything from painting to performance, but tends to gravitate most towards mixed-media and digital works. Currently she is a freshman at Parsons School of Design, majoring in Communication Design.</p>
